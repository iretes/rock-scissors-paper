# Rock, Scissors, Paper: the survival of the weakest ü™®‚úÇÔ∏èüìÑ

This project reproduces the experiments conducted by Frean et al. [[1]](#references) and Reichenbach et al. [[2], [3]](#references) to study a system involving three species in a competitive loop: a rock beats (and replicates into) a pair of scissors, scissors beat a sheet of paper and paper beats a rock. The self-referential nature of the competitive loop leads to counterintuitive phenomena, such as the expectation that the least competitive species will dominate in population. The proposed model is explored through various formalisms, and its properties are analyzed within each framework.

Additionally, we explore an oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators known as Repressilator. This network consists of a feedback loop with at least three genes, each encoding a protein that represses the expression of the next gene in the loop. The dynamic behavior of the Repressilator mirrors the competitive interactions of the rock-paper-scissors game, as each component cyclically inhibits the next. We investigate how this cyclical repression creates oscillatory patterns and maintains biological rhythms. This analysis is based on [[4]](#references).

## Ecological models

### Long range dispersal model

The notebook [`long_range_simulations.ipynb`](./notebooks/long_range_simulations.ipynb) analyzes simulations of the long-range dispersal model, treating individuals as gas molecules with interactions occurring between any pair of them.

The model is examined under both discrete and continuous time frameworks. For the continuous time approach, the differential equation system defining the model is solved using the¬†[`scipy.integrate`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html#module-scipy.integrate)¬†package. Additionally, the model is reframed in terms of chemical reactions for stochastic simulations, which are conducted using the¬†[`StochPy`](https://stochpy.sourceforge.net)¬†package. It is further examined as a continuous-time Markov chain with the [`PRISM`](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org) stochastic model checker and as a Petri net with the tool [`Charlie`](https://www-dssz.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/DSSZ/Software/Charlie).

### Lattice model

The notebook [`lattice_simulations.ipynb`](./notebooks/lattice_simulations.ipynb) analyzes simulations of the local range dispersal model, where individuals are situated on a lattice and interact solely with their neighbors.

This lattice-based model was developed using the [`Mesa`](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework.

#### How to run simulations from your browser

First, install the dependencies executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To interactively run the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python ./run_lattice_model.py
```

Set the grid's width and height, choose the model to run (either the one based on [[1]](#references), [[2]](#references), or a variant where agents activate simultaneously), and then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8521/."

The sliders labeled 'Initial weight of species *' allow you to set the weights used by the [`random.choices`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices) method from the Python Standard Library for initializing grid patches with individuals. These weights don't need to sum to $1$.

The sliders 'Swap rate', 'Reproduce rate' and 'Select rate' in the model based on [[2]](#references) have the same meaning as those in the NetLogo Rock-Paper-Scissors model [[3]](#references).

## Repressilator model

The notebook [`repressilator.ipynb`](./notebooks/repressilator.ipynb) analyzes simulations of the Repressilator model.

The system dynamics were simulated by solving the differential equations governing protein concentration changes, using the¬†[`scipy.integrate`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html#module-scipy.integrate)¬†package.
